                <h2> What is my ideal job in IT? </h2>

                <p align=justify> Working in recruitment, I see a lot of trends in roles and areas of IT, e.g. Cyber Security is quite the buzzword. However, it is worth noting that I only have exposure to the Brisbane IT market, which is small compared to other markets, e.g. Sydney, Melbourne, or even globally. So when I think of my future career, I am not 100% sure how that looks or where I see myself. I know from my time at Visualsoft that I love Project Management, working with customers, liaising with teams and working together to deliver the project. I also like the life cycle of projects, how it is new work to focus on, and every project has an end.</p>
                <p align=justify> With this in mind, my ideal job would be <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/58329738?type=promoted#sol=68907752028876d3fb16df8e1cc589f981ccf389" target="_blank">Principal Project Delivery</a> <a href ="Principal Project Delivery | Technology Asset East | Brisbane Job in East Brisbane, Brisbane QLD - SEEK.pdf">Role PDF</a></p>

                <h2> What is the position?</h2>
                <p align=justify> I have chosen this role as my ideal job as, from reviewing the position description, this role sits as part of a project delivery team working across a range of Technology Projects. This appeals to me as I believe I would like to gain knowledge and experience delivering projects across a diverse portfolio of IT rather than being specialised in one area. The portfolio includes Operational Technology (Digital Radio, wireless telemetry, network and data centres), Information Technology (production analysis initiatives, operational applications, cyber etc.) and Digital enablement (data-driven initiatives that improve safety, productivity and cost). I would love to work in a large organisation like BHP, where they have the resources and scope to work on such diverse and large-scale IT projects. I believe it would be a great organisation to work in for years to come, gaining experience across varied areas.</p>
