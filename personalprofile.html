            <h2>What does this mean to me, & how will this influence my behvaiour / team work?</h2>
            <p align=justify> I believe the test results show a good reflection of what I perceive to be my personality. For me, the Myers-Briggs test shows that I am a reserved / introverted person who will sit back and take an assessment of a situation before acting. However, although not overbearing in a group situation, the results show that when it comes to working, I am dedicated and will drive to achieve accomplishments. Similarly, the Learning Style Quiz results show that I would learn best when a rigorous plan works towards a defined goal. I believe the results show that being most effective when working to achieve a set goal, and I have the drive to go forward and accomplish this.</p>
            <p align=justify> The Myers-Briggs test states, 'For many Logisticians, a lack of structure offers not freedom, but chaos.' I can resonate with this statement as in my day-to-day work life; I am always looking for ways to structure-routine tasks and help manage the effectiveness of my team. For example, I currently work in recruitment, where we work a high number of contract roles which have deadlines. Therefore, I use tools such as our internal CRM (Bullhorn) and MS Outlook Calendar to organise reminders for these closing dates. This ensures I can manage priorities and subsequently share this information with our team to avoid missing deadlines and potentially losing roles, resulting in a loss of income for the business.</p>
            <p align=justify> Regarding working in a team, the Creativity test shows moderate 'boldness', meaning the confidence to push boundaries. However, I do not 100% agree with this evaluation as it is usually not until I know someone will I feel comfortable voicing concerns or pushing boundaries. The Myers-Briggs test explains that although Logisticians do not often express emotion, we can feel frustration and resentment when overcompensating for others in a team. With this in mind, when progressing to group work in assignment two, I will consciously speak up and voice my concerns early in the project to my peers rather than allowing for the usual building of silent frustration.</p>
