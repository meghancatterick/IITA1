          <h2> About Me </h2>

          <p align=justify> I am a Brit in Brisbane, chasing the sun & aspiring for bright future! I have lived in Brisbane collectively for two and a half years and just love the lifestyle and sunny weather it offers. I am from a small town in the North East of England called Darlington (If you are into your trains, you may have heard of it) and have worked in various roles but all across the IT industry. My dream is to have a career in IT as at the moment I have teetered on the edge in the world of IT recruitment and ecommerce project management. </p>
          <p align=justify> Currently, the highest level of education I hold is 3 AS Levels (English Language, Mathematics and Economics), unfortunately, I was not so driven when I was 17 to see this through to obtain A-Levels and ultimately go to university. Now, I feel ready, more mature and motivated to smash the Introduction to IT and Programming courses, ultimately allowing me to go on and complete a degree in IT and have a future filled with opportunity. </p>
          <p align=justify> Finally, a fun fact about me is that I enjoy boxing and have actually took part in two charity boxing fights raising money for <a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk" target="_blank">Macmillan Cancer Support</a>, I won both fights, one of which was by knock out!</p>
