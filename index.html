          <h2> About Me </h2>

          <p align=justify> I am a Brit in Brisbane, chasing the sun & aspiring for a bright future! I have lived in Brisbane collectively for two and a half years and love the lifestyle and sunny weather it offers. I am from a small town in the North East of England called Darlington (If you are into your trains, you may have heard of it) and have worked in various roles across the IT industry. My dream is to have a career in IT as, at the moment, I have teetered on the edge of the world of IT recruitment and eCommerce project management.</p>
          <p align=justify> Currently, the highest level of education I hold is 3 AS Levels (English Language, Mathematics and Economics); unfortunately, when I was 17, I didn't have the drive to see this through, obtain A-Levels and ultimately go to university. Now, I feel ready, more mature and motivated to smash the Introduction to IT and Programming courses, finally allowing me to go on and complete a degree in IT and have a future filled with opportunities.</p>
          <p align=justify> Finally, a fun fact about me is that I enjoy boxing and have participated in two charity boxing fights raising money for <a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk" target="_blank">Macmillan Cancer Support</a>, and I won both fights, one of which was by knockout!</p>
