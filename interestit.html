            <h2> What sparked my interest in IT? </h2>

            <p align=justify> I have always been aware of IT with a knowledge of how it impacts/improves my day-to-day life; however, when I relocated to Brisbane in 2019, I began to develop an interest in IT.</p>
            <p align=justify> When we arrived in Brisbane, I successfully secured a job in recruitment. In this role, I specialised in IT recruitment and worked across various roles, gaining insights into different IT career pathways. What I find most interesting is that IT is not just your role title, e.g. Project Manager, Developer, Business Analyst etc. But, it is more defined by the area of IT you specialise in, e.g. software, networking, cyber security etc.</p>
            <p align=justify> Come 2020, COVID hit, and my visa expired, forcing me back home to the UK. When back in the UK, I knew I was interested in IT and wanted to continue working in this sector. My next career move was Project Manager at Visualsoft, and I was successful in this role as I have considerable eCommerce experience. On reflection, I would comment that during my time at Visualsoft, I gained exposure within an IT environment which sparked my passion for IT and made me consider pursuing further education in IT.</p>
            <p align=justify> In this role, I worked closely alongside different departments (Design, Developers, System Administration, SEO, and Strategists). As a result, I witnessed the scale of what goes into something that we all take for granted - an eCommerce website. Since my time at Visualsoft, I have wanted to learn more about how IT comes together to improve our lives as it does today.</p>

            <h2> Why did I choose RMIT? </h2>

            <p align=justify> I chose RMIT University as part of the Open University because I work a full-time job and require the flexibility of study/lecture times that an online university provides. My employer has agreed to allow me one or two days off per week to study; however, these days may vary based on my job workload, deadlines and other staff leave. Therefore, RMIT allows me to spend an hour or so an evening listening to webinars, with the view of having two to three days per week to complete the course material and work on my assignments.</p>
            <p align=justify> Also, as I work in recruitment, I spend hours each day reviewing profiles of candidates and often sport RMIT on candidates resumes. From this, I know that RMIT is a recognised and well-regarded institution, and I am excited to be one of its successes.</p>

            <h2> What do I expect and want to learn during my studies?</h2>

            <p align=justify> During my studies, I hope to develop a broad understanding of IT and the components that enable IT to function in our society. This will include how the applications are programmed/built, how infrastructure allows them to work and how the security, governance, regulations, and safety protects its users. I hope to understand how this all comes together, who's the responsibility it is (what job role) and the progression of IT as a sector and the people that make it happen.</p>
            <p align=justify> After studying all these areas in detail within the introduction to IT course, I hope to understand what most interests me in IT so I can further study and develop a career down that path.</p>
