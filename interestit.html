            <h2> What sparked my interest in IT? </h2>

            <p align=justify> I have always been aware of IT with a knowledge of how it impacts / improves my day to day life, however, it was when I relocated to Brisbane in 2019 that I began to develop an interest in IT.</p>
            <p align=justify> When we arrived in Brisbane I was successful in securing a job in recruitment. In this role, I specialised in IT recruitment and worked across a range of roles, gaining insights and understanding into various IT career pathways. What I find most interesting is that IT is not just your role title e.g. Project Manager, Developer, Business Analyst etc. But, it is more defined by the area of IT you specialise in e.g. software, networking, cyber security etc.</p>
            <p align=justify> Come 2020, COVID hit and my visa expired forcing me back home to the UK. When back in the UK I knew I had an interest in IT and wanted to continue working in this sector. My next career move was Project Manager at Visualsoft, I was successful in this role as I have considerable eCommerce experience. On reflection I would comment that it was during my time at Visualsoft that I gained exposure in a real IT environment which sparked my passion for IT and made me consider to pursue further eduction in IT.</p>
            <p align=justify> In this role, I worked closely alongside different departments (Design, Developers, System Administration, SEO, Strategists) and witnessed first hand the scale of what goes into something that we all take for granted - an ecommerce website. Since my time at Visualsoft I have wanted to learn more about how IT comes together to improve our lives as it does today.</p>

            <h2> Why did I choose RMIT? </h2>

            <p align=justify> I chose RMIT University as part of Open University because I work a full time job and require the flexibility of study / lecture times that an online university provides. My employer has agreed to allow me 1 or 2 days off per week to study, however, these days may vary based on my job workload, deadlines and other staff leave. Therefore, RMIT allows me to spend an hour or so on an evening listening to webinars, with then the view to have a two - three days per week to complete the course material and work on my assignments.</p>
            <p align=justify> Also, as I work in recruitment, I spend hours each day reviewing profiles of candidates and often sport RMIT on candidates resumes. From this I know that RMIT is a recognised and well regarded institution and I am excited to be one of their successes.</p>

            <h2> What do I expect and want to learn during my studies?</h2>

            <p align=justify> During my studies I hope to develop a broad understanding of IT on a whole and the components which enable IT to function in our society. This will include how the applications are programmed / built, how infrastructure allows it all to work and how the security, governance, regulations and safety protects its users.</p>
            <p align=justify> I hope to understand how this all comes together, who's responsibility it is (what job role) and the progression of IT as a sector and the people that make it happen.</p>
            <p align=justify> Following studying all these areas in detailed within the introduction to IT course, I then hope to gain an understanding of what most interests me in IT so I can do further study and develop a career down that path.</p>
