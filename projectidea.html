              <h2> What is LendIt? </h2>

              <p align=justify> LendIt is an iOS based app, which allows users in nearby locations to share, review and <em>lend</em> items of neighbours / fellow users of the app. The purpose of LendIt is to allow users to easily access items that they may not want or need to purchase for one time uses, whilst allowing the owner of the product to earn some extra cash for items which they may not like or use as much. This project will establish a basic version of the application which will allow users to begin to connect with one another and enjoy the concept of LendIt! </p>

              <h2> How will LendIt help others? </h2>

              <p align=justify> Following the effects of a global pandemic, a study which surveyed more than 7,000 Australians during May-June 2022 showed that 49% of respondents had experienced some reduction in income, and 30% a significant reduction in income due to COVID-19. With this in mind, people are less likely to purchase one off unnecessary goods for single events. The LendIt app will connect neighbours in the community and allowing them to lend items at a much less significant cost of buying a new item. </p> https://aifs.gov.au/media/spending-less-worrying-more-how-covid-19-impacting-financial-wellbeing

              <p align=justify> With the rise and continued dominance of social media, communities are interacting online for multiple purposes such as: advice, suggestions, social, purchasing and borrowing of items. Facebook Marketplace has 1 billion active users per month, all of which engage in purchasing or hire transactions of goods and services. This coupled with countless "Buy, Sell, Swap" groups on the platform, evidences there is a rise in activity for users engaging on the platform for more than just social interaction. LendIt, would operate a community, similar to the likes of Facebook Market place, however, solely for the purpose of lending items - not purchasing. </p> https://leadsbridge.com/blog/facebook-marketplace/

              <h3> Phase One: </h3>

              <p align=justify> The LendIt app will initially be built for iOS as I plan to release LendIt phase one into the local Australian market where iOS holds 57.15% of the market share.</p> https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/australia The first release of the LendIt app will include the following features:

              <ul>
                <li align=justify> Geolocation services - we will incorporate Apple MapKit to allow users to share location of products. This will work by showing points on maps where products are located, users browsing products can then view where they are in the nearby neighbourhood. I did consider using Google Maps API as this is accessible on all devices, however, as phase one is to build the app on iOS I thought the benefit of Apple MapKit being more user friendly to outweigh this consideration; </li> https://www.mobindustry.net/blog/how-to-create-a-location-based-app-ideas-technologies-and-examples/ & https://www.mobindustry.net/blog/google-maps-vs-apple-maps-best-choice-for-your-mobile-solution/
                <li align=justify> Messaging function - there will be a messaging function on the app, which will allow users to reach out to the owner of the item and request to <em>LendIt</em>. From there the two users would organise via the messaging function the exchange of the item; </li>
                <li align=justify> Database - the app will allow users to sign-up and create accounts to use LendIt. This information, coupled with the data stored when a user posts a product available to lend requires the data to be stored in a database. The database I will implement is SQLite, I have chose this database as it requires no installation / configuration, so hopefully this should not add too much time to the development timeline. SQLite is very versatile and can be used with various platforms and used with multiple languages. This will allow for this database to sustain with the app in future developments / phase releases;</li> https://www.trio.dev/blog/best-ios-database
              </ul>

              <p align=justify> As detailed above, phase one will include basic features to get the app up, running and functional. I have planned it this way as I am conscious if we are to complete this by assignment 3, it needs to be challeging yet feesible. I believe the features described will allow for effective use of the app and will still achieve the outcome of connecting local neighbours with items they may require to lend.</p>

              <h3> Phase Two: </h3>

              <p align=justify> In the second dream phase of development, we will integrate a payment gateway to allow for security deposits to be taken through the app. For example: you can lend this item, but a security deposit of $X amount will be held on your card in case of none-return, damages or cleaning fee. This will allow for peace of mind of users listing products and should hopefully lead to an increase in activity on the app. I would implement ApplePay and Apple in app purchasing through the users Apple account initally as the payment option, with the view to expand this in he future as the app is offered on other non-iOS platforms. </p> https://www.techugo.com/blog/integrate-payment-gateway-ios-app/

              <h3> Phase Three: </h3>

              <p align=justify> In the third release, we will incorporate a delivery service, similar to the likes of UberEATS. A users can <em>lend</em> and item of another user and the delivery service collects, drops and returns the item, door to door making this and easy to use the service. For example, you could be in the middle of a DIY project and find you need a hammer, you open your LendIt app and see your neighbour has one, you can either collect the item yourself, or as you are in the middle of a project, use the delivery service to get this to you in the hour.</p>

              <p align=justify> Delivery service apps such as Uber Eats have changed the way we order items significantly. Once upon a Saturday night in 2004, XFactor is on, Mum says it is takeway for tea! She calls the local pizza shop, puts in th order, then we all sit paitently waiting for our food to arrive. Twitching the blinds, looking out the window at every single car which drives down the street, counting out the cash to make sure there is the right amount to give to the driver. However, now - thanks to the continous evolution of technology, gone are the days of awkward eye contact with your neighbour, through the window, who you thought must be your 12" chicken feast pizza! </p>

              <p align=justify> Specifically Uber Eats is the most popular food delivery service, with 81 million users internationally! That is 81 million people who have adapted and got onboard with the revolutionised way to order. We can now pay with our cards or phones, track our drivers every move and even tell them to leave it at the door meaning no awkward contact - what more could you want. </p> https://www.businessofapps.com/data/uber-eats-statistics/

              <p align=justify> I believe, if we could implement this similar technology into other goods and services on a hire basis, this would equally take off as humanbeings not only love continous improving of convience to our everday life, but also not spending large sums of money on one time use times. </p>

            <article>
              <h2> How can you achieve this? </h2>

              <p align=justify> Although I passionately believe that LendIt could be the next big thing, when fully developed, I understand I must learn to crawl before I can walk and walk before I can run. At this stage, in the world of application development, I am very much learning to crawl. </p>

              <p align=justify> I have detailed the inital features the app will include above, to reiterate this will include: geolocation services, messaging functions and a database. </p>

              <p align=justify> Before I can look to implement any features to LendIt, I need to establish the base of it. As this is an iOS app, it will be developed using Swift, however, I am currently not an expert or even novice in Swift and therefore will lean on the MIT App Inventor tool. </p> https://www.apple.com/au/swift/ & https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/get-started

              <p align=justify> Once I have my basic app up and running I will integrate features such as the Apple MapKit, messaging functions and SQLite. I will achieve this by following the guidance of the MIT App Inventor and also various online sources which offer support information with regard to developing apps. </p>

              <p align=justify> I hope this should be feesible as I have kept the initial version of the applications <em>fairly</em> basic. </p>

              <h2> The End Result </h2>

              <p align=justify> By assignment three, I hope to have sucessfully created phase one of my project idea - LendIt. I believe once LendIt version one is create and available to market the intial impact will be that it creates a different community, specifically focused on neighbours in the local area.

              <p align=justify> Similar concepts e.g. Facebook Marketplace are useful for a local marketplace now, however, Facebook was and still is very much a social platform used to stay connected with family and friends. </p>

              <p align=justify> LendIt will create a community dedicated to those who want to lend items from near by neighbours. I hope this will initally have a positive social impact and although the primary purpose may be to lend goods and services, it may also connect people together. </p>

              <p align=justify> Additionally, I hope the geolocation feature highlights the accessibility and convience of products to lend for those who have been effected by loss in income due to the pandemic. This should connect people with cheaper to lend products, opposed to the high cost of buying items new.</p>
