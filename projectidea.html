              <h2> What is LendIt? </h2>

              <p align=justify> LendIt is an iOS-based app which allows users in nearby locations to share, review and <em>lend</em> items to neighbours / fellow users of the app. The purpose of LendIt is to enable users to easily access products they may not want or need to purchase for one-time uses while allowing the owner to earn some extra cash for items they may not like or use as much. This project will establish a basic version of the application, allowing users to begin to connect and enjoy the concept of LendIt!</p>

              <h2> How will LendIt help others? </h2>

              <p align=justify> Following the effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic, a study which surveyed more than 7,000 Australians from May to June 2022 showed that 49% of respondents had experienced some reduction in income and 30% a significant salary reduction. With this in mind, people are less likely to purchase one-off unnecessary goods for single events. The LendIt app will connect neighbours in the community and allow them to lend items at a much lower cost than buying a new item.<a href="https://aifs.gov.au/media/spending-less-worrying-more-how-covid-19-impacting-financial-wellbeing" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>

              <p align=justify> With social media's rise and continued dominance, communities interact online for multiple purposes such as advice, suggestions, social, purchasing, and borrowing items. For example, Facebook Marketplace has 1 billion active users per month, all of which engage in purchasing or hire transactions of goods and services. Coupled with countless "Buy, Sell, Swap" groups on the platform, it proves there is a rise in activity for users engaging on the platform for more than just social interaction. LendIt, would operate a community similar to the likes of Facebook Market place, however, solely for lending items - not purchasing.<a href="https://leadsbridge.com/blog/facebook-marketplace/" target="_blank">[2]</a></p>

              <h2> Tell me more! </h2>

              <h3> Phase One: </h3>

              <p align=justify> Initially, the LendIt app will be built for iOS as I plan to release LendIt phase one into the local Australian market, where iOS holds 57.15% of the market share.<a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/australia" target="_blank">[3]</a></p>
              
              <p>The first release of the LendIt app will include the following features:</p>

              <ul>
                <li align=justify> Geolocation services - we will incorporate Apple MapKit to allow users to share the location of products. This will work by showing the location of products on a map; users browsing products can then view where they are in the nearby neighbourhood. I did consider using Google Maps API as this is accessible on all devices; however, as phase one is to build the app on iOS, I thought the benefit of Apple MapKit being more user-friendly outweighs this consideration; <a href="https://www.mobindustry.net/blog/how-to-create-a-location-based-app-ideas-technologies-and-examples/" target="_blank">[4]</a> <a href="https://www.mobindustry.net/blog/google-maps-vs-apple-maps-best-choice-for-your-mobile-solution/" target="_blank">[5]</a></li>
                <li align=justify> Messaging function - there will be a messaging function on the app, allowing users to reach out to the item's owner and request <em>LendIt</em>. From there, the two users would organise the exchange via message;</li>
                <li align=justify> Database - the app will allow users to sign-up and create accounts to use LendIt. This information, coupled with the data stored when a user posts a product available to lend, requires the data to be stored in a database. The database I will implement is SQLite. I have chosen this database as it requires no installation/configuration, so hopefully, this should not add too much time to the development timeline. SQLite is versatile, and multiple platforms and languages use it, future-proofing developments/phase releases;<a href="https://www.trio.dev/blog/best-ios-database" target="_blank">[6]</a></li>
              </ul>

              <p align=justify> As detailed above, phase one will include basic features to keep the app running and functional. I have planned it this way as I am conscious that if we complete this by assignment 3, it needs to be challenging yet feasible. However, I believe the features described will allow for effective use of the app and will still achieve the outcome of connecting local neighbours with items they may require to lend.</p>

              <h3> Phase Two: </h3>

              <p align=justify> In the second dream development phase, we will integrate a payment gateway to allow security deposits through the app. So, for example, you can lend this item, but a security deposit of $X amount will be held on your card in case of non-return, damages or cleaning fee. This will allow for peace of mind for users listing products and hopefully lead to increased activity on the app. Initially, as the purchase option, I would implement ApplePay and Apple in-app purchasing through the user's Apple account, with the view to expand this in the future on other non-iOS platforms.<a href="https://www.techugo.com/blog/integrate-payment-gateway-ios-app/" target="_blank">[7]</a><p>

              <h3> Phase Three: </h3>

              <p align=justify> In the third release, we will incorporate a delivery service similar to UberEATS. A user can lend another user's item, and the delivery service collects, drops and returns the object door to door, making this an easy-to-use service. For example, you could be in the middle of a DIY project and find you need a hammer; you open your LendIt app and see your neighbour has one. You can either collect the item yourself or use the delivery service to get this to you in the hour.</p>

              <p align=justify> Delivery service apps such as Uber Eats have significantly changed how we order items. For example, on a Saturday night in 2004, XFactor is on, and Mum says it is takeaway for tea! She calls the local pizza shop, puts in the order, and then we all sit patiently waiting for our food to arrive. We were twitching the blinds, looking out the window at every car that drives down the street, and counting out the cash to ensure the right amount to give to the driver. However, now - thanks to the continuous evolution of technology, gone are the days of awkward eye contact with your neighbour, through the window, who you thought must be your 12" chicken feast pizza!</p>

              <p align=justify> Specifically, UberEATS is the most popular food delivery service, with 81 million users internationally! That is 81 million people who have adapted and got on board with the revolutionised way to order. We can now pay with our cards or phones, track our drivers' every move and even tell them to leave it at the door meaning no awkward contact - what more could you want? <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/uber-eats-statistics/" target="_blank">[8]</a></p>

              <p align=justify> If we could implement a similar technology into hiring goods and services, this would have a chance of taking off as people love the convenience and not spending large sums of money on one-time use times.</p>

              <h2> How will I achieve this? </h2>

              <p align=justify> Although I passionately believe that LendIt could be the next big thing, when fully developed, I understand I must learn to crawl before I can walk and walk before I can run. At this stage, in the application development world, I am learning to crawl.</p>

              <p align=justify> I have detailed the initial features the app will include above. But, to reiterate, this will consist of: geolocation services, messaging functions and a database.</p>

              <p align=justify> Before I can look to implement any features to LendIt, I need to establish the base of it. This iOS app will be developed using Swift; however, I am currently a novice in Swift and lean on the MIT App Inventor tool.<a href="https://www.apple.com/au/swift/" target="_blank">[8]</a> <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/get-started" target="_blank">[10]</a></p>

              <p align=justify> Once I have my basic app up and running, I will integrate features such as the Apple MapKit, messaging functions and SQLite. I will achieve this by following the MIT App Inventor's guidance and various online sources that offer support information about developing apps.</p>

              <p align=justify> I hope this should be feasible as I have kept the initial version of the applications <em>fairly</em> basic. </p>

              <h2> The End Result </h2>

              <p align=justify> By assignment three, I hope to have successfully created phase one of my project idea - LendIt. I believe once the first version of LendIt is designed and available to the market, the initial impact will be that it creates a different community, specifically focused on neighbours in the local area.</p>

              <p align=justify> Similar concepts, e.g. Facebook Marketplace is useful for a local marketplace now; however, Facebook was and still is very much a social platform used to stay connected with family and friends. </p>

              <p align=justify> LendIt will create a community dedicated to those who want to lend items from nearby neighbours. I hope this will initially have a positive social impact, and although the primary purpose may be to lend goods and services, it may also connect people. </p>

              <p align=justify> Additionally, the geolocation feature will provide the accessibility and convenience of products to those affected by loss in income due to the pandemic by connecting people with cheaper products instead an expensive outright purchase.</p>
